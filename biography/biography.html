            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup>My childhood was deeply influenced by the world of computers and technology. <sup>2</sup>My father owned a small computer shop, which became my second home. <sup>3</sup>While other children played outside, I spent my time watching computer parts being assembled. <sup>4</sup>I was fascinated by the <b>green motherboards</b> and tiny electronic components. <sup>5</sup>Every day felt like a new lesson inside that shop. <sup>6</sup>I learned early that computers were not just machines but systems that required harmony. <sup>7</sup>My father taught me patience and discipline when handling hardware. <sup>8</sup>I still remember holding a processor carefully, afraid of bending its pins. <sup>9</sup>This moment sparked my curiosity about how technology worked. <sup>10</sup>I began asking questions about RAM, hard drives, and power supplies. <sup>11</sup>Watching was no longer enough for me. <sup>12</sup>I wanted to participate and build something myself. <sup>13</sup>My father guided me step by step as I installed components. <sup>14</sup>The sound of a component clicking into place excited me. <sup>15</sup>Each successful build gave me confidence. <sup>16</sup>I learned the importance of compatibility and organization. <sup>17</sup>Cable management taught me discipline and cleanliness. <sup>18</sup>Technology stopped being mysterious and became familiar. <sup>19</sup>I felt proud when friends asked for help fixing their computers. <sup>20</sup>Those childhood experiences shaped my love for technology.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup>As I entered my teenage years, my hobby evolved into a serious skill. <sup>2</sup>In high school, my teachers noticed my strong hardware knowledge. <sup>3</sup>I was chosen to represent my school in a PC assembly competition. <sup>4</sup>The pressure was intense, but I trusted my experience. <sup>5</sup>I practiced assembling computers repeatedly at home. <sup>6</sup>Speed and accuracy became my focus. <sup>7</sup>On competition day, I relied on muscle memory. <sup>8</sup>My hands moved confidently, just like my father taught me. <sup>9</sup>I placed second place, which filled me with pride. <sup>10</sup>That achievement motivated me to aim higher. <sup>11</sup>In senior high school, I joined a robotics project using Arduino. <sup>12</sup>I worked on motors, sensors, and wiring. <sup>13</sup>I realized hardware needed software to function properly. <sup>14</sup>This realization pushed me to learn programming. <sup>15</sup>I enjoyed writing logic that controlled machines. <sup>16</sup>Our robot project won Best Thesis Group Project. <sup>17</sup>This proved my ability in both hardware and coding. <sup>18</sup>I competed against other skilled students from different schools. <sup>19</sup>These experiences broadened my perspective on technology. <sup>20</sup>My teenage years connected my past to my future.

            <h2>College Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup>Entering college forced me to make an important decision. <sup>2</sup>Many expected me to take <strong>BSIT</strong> because of my hardware skills. <sup>3</sup>Instead, I chose <em>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</em>. <sup>4</sup>I wanted to understand how computers think and process data. <sup>5</sup>Building hardware alone was no longer enough for me. <sup>6</sup>Computer science challenged my problem-solving abilities. <sup>7</sup>I learned programming languages and algorithms. <sup>8</sup>Abstract thinking became part of my daily routine. <sup>9</sup>My hardware background gave me an advantage. <sup>10</sup>I understood how software interacts with physical machines. <sup>11</sup>This dual skill set strengthened my confidence. <sup>12</sup>I continued to fix computers while learning to code. <sup>13</sup>Debugging programs felt similar to troubleshooting hardware. <sup>14</sup>I realized my past experiences still mattered. <sup>15</sup>I consider hardware knowledge a valuable asset. <sup>16</sup>My goal is to work in a leading tech company. <sup>17</sup>I also dream of building my own technology business. <sup>18</sup>College helped me discover my true potential. <sup>19</sup>I now see technology as both art and science. <sup>20</sup>This journey excites me as I move toward the future.
