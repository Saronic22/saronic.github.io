            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                My childhood was deeply influenced by the world of computers and technology. My father owned a small computer shop, which became my second home. While other children played outside, I spent my time watching computer parts being assembled. I was fascinated by the <b>green motherboards</b> and tiny electronic components. Every day felt like a new lesson inside that shop. I learned early that computers were not just machines but systems that required harmony. My father taught me patience and discipline when handling hardware. I still remember holding a processor carefully, afraid of bending its pins. This moment sparked my curiosity about how technology worked. I began asking questions about RAM, hard drives, and power supplies. Watching was no longer enough for me. I wanted to participate and build something myself. My father guided me step by step as I installed components. The sound of a component clicking into place excited me. Each successful build gave me confidence. I learned the importance of compatibility and organization. Cable management taught me discipline and cleanliness. Technology stopped being mysterious and became familiar. I felt proud when friends asked for help fixing their computers. Those childhood experiences shaped my love for technology.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                As I entered my teenage years, my hobby evolved into a serious skill. In high school, my teachers noticed my strong hardware knowledge. I was chosen to represent my school in a PC assembly competition. The pressure was intense, but I trusted my experience. I practiced assembling computers repeatedly at home. Speed and accuracy became my focus. On competition day, I relied on muscle memory. My hands moved confidently, just like my father taught me. I placed second place, which filled me with pride. That achievement motivated me to aim higher. In senior high school, I joined a robotics project using Arduino. I worked on motors, sensors, and wiring. I realized hardware needed software to function properly. This realization pushed me to learn programming. I enjoyed writing logic that controlled machines. Our robot project won Best Thesis Group Project. This proved my ability in both hardware and coding. I competed against other skilled students from different schools. These experiences broadened my perspective on technology. My teenage years connected my past to my future.

            <h2>College Years</h2>
            <p>
                Entering college forced me to make an important decision. Many expected me to take <strong>BSIT</strong> because of my hardware skills. Instead, I chose <em>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</em>. I wanted to understand how computers think and process data. Building hardware alone was no longer enough for me. Computer science challenged my problem-solving abilities. I learned programming languages and algorithms. Abstract thinking became part of my daily routine. My hardware background gave me an advantage. I understood how software interacts with physical machines. This dual skill set strengthened my confidence. I continued to fix computers while learning to code. Debugging programs felt similar to troubleshooting hardware. I realized my past experiences still mattered. I consider hardware knowledge a valuable asset. My goal is to work in a leading tech company. I also dream of building my own technology business. College helped me discover my true potential. I now see technology as both art and science. This journey excites me as I move toward the future.
