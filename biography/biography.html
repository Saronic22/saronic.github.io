            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                My childhood was deeply influenced by the world of computers and technology. My father owned a small computer shop, which became my second home. While other children played outside, I spent my time watching computer parts being assembled. I was fascinated by the <b>green motherboards</b> and tiny electronic components. Every day felt like a new lesson inside that shop. I learned early that computers were not just machines but systems that required harmony. My father taught me patience and discipline when handling hardware. I still remember holding a processor carefully, afraid of bending its pins. This moment sparked my curiosity about how technology worked. I began asking questions about RAM, hard drives, and power supplies. Watching was no longer enough for me. I wanted to participate and build something myself. My father guided me step by step as I installed components. The sound of a component clicking into place excited me. Each successful build gave me confidence. I learned the importance of compatibility and organization. Cable management taught me discipline and cleanliness. Technology stopped being mysterious and became familiar. I felt proud when friends asked for help fixing their computers. Those childhood experiences shaped my love for technology.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                As I entered my teenage years, my hobby evolved into a serious skill. In high school, my teachers noticed my strong hardware knowledge. I was chosen to represent my school in a PC assembly competition. The pressure was intense, but I trusted my experience. I practiced assembling computers repeatedly at home. Speed and accuracy became my focus. On competition day, I relied on muscle memory. My hands moved confidently, just like my father taught me. I placed second place, which filled me with pride. That achievement motivated me to aim higher. In senior high school, I joined a robotics project using Arduino. I worked on motors, sensors, and wiring. I realized hardware needed software to function
