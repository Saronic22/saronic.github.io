                        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
                        <p>
                            My childhood was deeply influenced by the world of computers. My father owned a small computer shop, which became my second home. While other children played outside, I spent my time watching computer parts being assembled. I was fascinated by the <strong>green motherboards</strong> and tiny electronic components. Every day felt like a new lesson inside that shop. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I learned early that computers were not just machines but systems that required harmony. I still remember holding a processor carefully, afraid of bending its pins—a moment that sparked my curiosity about how technology worked. Technology stopped being mysterious and became familiar.

                        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
                        <p>
                            In high school, my hobby evolved into a serious skill. I was chosen to represent my school in a PC assembly competition. Speed and accuracy became my focus, and I placed <strong>second place</strong> nationally. That achievement motivated me to aim higher. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In senior high, I joined a robotics project using Arduino. I realized hardware needed software to function properly, which pushed me to learn programming. Our robot won <em>Best Thesis Group Project</em>, proving my ability to bridge the gap between hardware and coding.

                        <h2>College Years</h2>
                        <p>
                            Entering college, many expected me to take BSIT because of my hardware skills. Instead, I chose <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong>. I wanted to understand how computers think and process data. Abstract thinking became part of my daily routine, and my hardware background gave me a massive advantage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Debugging programs felt similar to troubleshooting hardware. Today, I see technology as both art and science, and I dream of building my own technology business in the future.
