            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I started my journey in tech, my laptop has felt less like a gadget and more like an extension of my brain. There’s a common misconception na basta CS ka, "magaling ka lang sa computer," but the truth is, we are only as good as the tools we master. Looking back at my daily workflow, there are a few specific platforms that have saved me from total burnout and technical chaos.
            </p>

            <h2>The All-in-One Office: Google Workspace</h2>
            <p>
                If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that collaboration is the backbone of any CS project. I honestly don’t know how I’d survive without Google Workspace. Whether I’m drafting documentation in Docs or managing project timelines in Sheets, the real-time collaboration is a lifesaver. Gone are the days of emailing "Final_Version_v2" back and forth; now, everything is just there, synced and ready. It’s my digital headquarters where all my ideas actually get organized.
            </p>

            <h2>My Creative Escape: Canva</h2>
            <p>
                I’ll admit it: as an CS person, sometimes my "design eye" is just not there. That’s where Canva comes in to save my dignity. When I need to present a system architecture or just create a clean UI mockup, Canva makes me look like a professional graphic designer even if I’m just dragging and dropping elements. It’s my go-to tool when I want to translate "tech-speak" into something visual and easy for everyone else to understand.
            </p>

            <h2>The Sandbox: Virtual Machines (VMs)</h2>
            <p>
                Now, for the more technical side of my life—Virtual Machines. As someone who loves to tinker with different operating systems and risky scripts, VMs are my safety net. Instead of risking my main machine, I can spin up a Linux environment or a test Windows server, break it completely, and just hit "delete" without any stress. It gives me the freedom to fail and learn, which I think is the most important part of being in CS.
            </p>

            <h2>Reflection: My Personal Takeaway</h2>
            <p>
                Realizing how much I depend on these tools made me reflect on how CS isn't just about hardware; it's about the ecosystem we build for ourselves. These tools don't just make me faster—they make me more creative and less afraid to experiment. My advice to anyone starting out is to find your own "digital toolkit" early on. Don't just use a tool because it's popular; use it because it makes your life easier and your work better.
