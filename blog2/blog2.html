            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s be real for a second: Does anyone actually know what they’re doing? Sometimes, looking at my schedule feels scarier than staring at a compiler error that simply says "Segmentation fault" with zero explanation. Being a Computer Science student, nasanay na ako sa logic, syntax, and structured code. Everything in our course has a specific structure, a specific rule. Pero sa totoong buhay? It’s chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to think that "being productive" meant cramming until 3 AM and surviving on caffeine. But recently, I hit a wall. I realized that while I could debug a program, I was failing to debug my own daily life. That’s when I asked myself: <strong>Why am I so organized with my code but so messy with my time?</strong>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The "WBS" Experiment</h2>
            <p>
                It sounds nerdy, I know, but I decided to apply a concept we learn in class to my actual life: the <strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last December, I tried something different. Instead of just listing "Study" on a piece of paper and staring at it for hours, I broke my week down completely. I made a clear distinction between "Routines" and "Activities."
            </p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h3>My Life Algorithm:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Routines (The Constants):</strong> These are the non-negotiables: Cooking, eating, taking a bath, and yes—sleeping. (Dati, optional lang ‘to sakin).</li>
                    <li><strong>Activities (The Variables):</strong> These are the projects, the reviews for quizzes, the unexpected errands.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                By seeing them as separate categories, narealize ko kung gaano karaming oras ang nakakain ng "routine" tasks na madalas kong ini-ignore. Dati, I would allot 2 hours for a project but forget that I also need to eat and prep. Result? Cramming. By acknowledging the routine parts of my day, I actually found <em>more</em> time for the heavy lifting.
            </p>

            <h2>Rest is Not Lazy, It’s Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
                One of the hardest lessons for me was accepting that rest isn't laziness. Sa mindset kasi nating mga students, kapag hindi ka gumagawa ng assignment, parang kasalanan. We feel guilty for taking a break.
            </p>
            <p>
                But looking at my schedule visually made me realize something important: <strong>You cannot run a high-performance program on hardware that is overheating.</strong> Tao lang tayo, hindi machine. Treating my rest periods as "scheduled maintenance" rather than "wasted time" changed my perspective. I learned that stepping away from the screen—kahit saglit lang—actually helps me solve problems faster when I get back.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Surviving college isn’t just about being the smartest person in the room or memorizing every conversion from Binary to Hexadecimal. Sometimes, it’s just about showing up for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                My takeaway? <strong>Structure gives you freedom.</strong> When you plan your chaos, hindi ka na alipin ng oras mo. You gain control. So, to my fellow students struggling to keep up: try stepping back. Organize your day not just by what you need to submit, but by what you need to <em>survive</em>.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding-left: 15px;">
                If you can organize complex data structures, kaya mo ring i-organize ang buhay mo. One line at a time.
